# CERTLEDGER-DECENTRALIZED-CHAIN-FOR-AUTHENTICITY-ASSURANCE
![unnamed](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ede814f5-408a-40cf-b26a-9d291dc70787)

This project allows institutes to issue digital certificates secured with blockchain technology. The data is immutable and tamper-proof, ensuring authenticity and easy verification, while eliminating the risk of forgery and reducing manual validation efforts.

->This system leverages blockchain technology to issue, manage, and verify digital academic certificates in a secure, transparent, and decentralized way, eliminating traditional risks like forgery, loss, and inefficiencies.
->System Architecture and Components
->Users authenticate via MetaMask wallets.
**Role-based dashboards:**
->Institute Dashboard for authorized personnel.
->Student Dashboard for learners.
->Smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain handle:
->Certificate issuance
->Certificate verification
->Secure storage on blockchain (Certificate Chain & Correction Chain for edits)
->It is a blockchain-based project for online certificate issuing and validation for an institute.
->The major problem of counterfeit certificates can be tackled, as it provides a solution to preserve the immutability of a certificate.
->It works on the idea that: “Only the institute can upload the certificate and the rest people can only view it.” The entire process works on the blockchain in partnership with the smart contracts.
->Does Everything for Certificates: Storing, Validating, and issuing.
->Thus, this is a modern and hassle-free solution to manage and verify certificates!

**Flow of project:**
Both users will be able to login using the Metamask and in Metamask accounts. We have already kept RPC from Ganache. So we will have a test ETH in the account.
**METAMASK**

->Form to be filled by the institute as certificate details:

-> Then the ETH transaction to issue the certificate:

-> Recent certificates that have been issued and to whom they have been issued:

->The certificate will be sent to the student by the Metamask wallet ID:

-> The student can view and download the certificate.

->As each certificate is generated, the certificates consist of a certificate ID and the issuing by, So using the certificate if anyone can verify the certificate.

**Verification of Certificate**
-> The if will be entered, and we can know the authenticity of the certificate.

As every detail is given as it provides authenticity.
